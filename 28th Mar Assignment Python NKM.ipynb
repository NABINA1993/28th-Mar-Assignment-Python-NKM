    "Ridge regression is a type of linear regression model that is used to handle multicollinearity, which is a phenomenon where two or more predictor variables in a regression model are highly correlated. The Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression cost function to reduce the magnitudes of the regression coefficients, thereby reducing the impact of multicollinearity on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The penalty term in Ridge regression is called the \"L2 regularization\" term, which is the sum of the squares of the regression coefficients multiplied by a hyperparameter, lambda (λ). The value of lambda determines the strength of the regularization and the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients. Larger values of lambda lead to more shrinkage and simpler models, while smaller values of lambda lead to less shrinkage and more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression does not include any penalty term in the cost function. It estimates the regression coefficients by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the response variable. OLS regression can lead to overfitting when the number of predictor variables is large or when multicollinearity is present in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, Ridge regression is a regularization technique that helps to prevent overfitting and improve the stability of the regression estimates, especially in cases where multicollinearity is present."

    "Ridge regression is a type of linear regression model that has some assumptions, which are similar to the assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. These assumptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable should be linear.\n",

    "Independence: The observations in the dataset should be independent of each other.\n",

Therefore, it is important to select an optimal value of lambda to balance between model complexity and predictive accuracy.\n",
